  I recently graduated in [Modelling Mathematics](https://www.ljll.fr/MathModel/presentation/mbio.html) at Sorbonne-Université.  I am currently considering any PhD opportunity that involve interdisciplinarity, and particularly interactions between mathematics and behavioural sciences or related disciplines, such as ethology, behavioral ecology, demography, population       dynamics, etc.

  Throughout my academic background and my interships I have acquired many skills that range from <mark>Functional analysis</mark> to <mark>Stochastic process</mark>. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and their usages as well.
