  I recently graduated in [Modelling Mathematics](https://www.ljll.fr/MathModel/presentation/mbio.html) at Sorbonne-Université.  I am currently considering any PhD opportunity involving interdisciplinarity, and interactions between mathematics and diverse social sciences disciplines, such as ethology, behavioral ecology, demography, population dynamics, etc.

  Throughout my academic background and my interships I have acquired many skills that range from <mark>Functional analysis</mark> to <mark>Stochastic process</mark>. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and their usages as well.
